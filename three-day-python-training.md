PLEASE READ
---------

- Read the requirements carefully, figure out how to solve the problem before starting to write any code.
- !!! **Any input required needs to given as command line argument. DO NOT ask user for input.** !!!
  - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm
- Error handling / edge case handling
  - Always check if user has provided required number of arguments in command line and in correct format - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-check-for-float-string/
  - Any error must be printed out so its easy for user to read and understand what was wrong.

Below is a list of tutorial exercises to do.

Python Exercises
---------

**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

**Find e to the Nth Digit** - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

**Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

**Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor** - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.

**Coin Flip Simulation** - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

**Fizz Buzz** - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

**Reverse a String** - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

**Pig Latin** - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

**Page Scraper** - Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. *Optional: Organize the indexed content and don’t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.*

**GIF Creator** A program that puts together multiple images (PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs) to make a smooth GIF that can be exported. *Optional: Make the program convert small video files to GIFs as well.*
