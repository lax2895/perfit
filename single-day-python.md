**PLEASE READ :-**
1.  Read the requirements carefully, figure out how to solve the problem before starting to write any code.
2.  Any input required needs to given as command line argument. DO NOT ask user for input.
    - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_command_line_arguments.htm
3.  Error handling / edge case handling
    - Always check if user has provided required number of arguments in command line and in correct format - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-check-for-float-string/
    - Any error must be printed out so its easy for user to read and understand what was wrong.

**PYTHON PROGRAMS TO DO :-**
1. Find and print the biggest of three numbers.
   - Program must take three numbers as command line arguments.
   - Program must handle all edge cases like – user might not give three numbers, they may not be numbers etc. Print appropriate error messages in all those cases.
2. Given a number, find where in the Fibonacci series it occurs [THIS IS NOT GENERATE NTH NUMBER IN FIBONACCI SERIES, READ THE QUESTION PROPERLY]
   - For eg, the series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 …
   - If user enters 21, output should be 9 since it is the 9th in the sequence
   - If user enters 45, output should be 11
   - If number is not in the sequence, it has to print -1
3.  Python function which will accept a long string and print the word which occurs the highest number of times.
    Rough layout:
    ```
    def count_words(user_input):
      your_code
      print(answer)
    count_words(“random words paper place words butterfly compiler then there words”)
    ```
    Output here would be-
    words
